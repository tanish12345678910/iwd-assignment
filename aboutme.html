        <h1 id="habout">About Me</h1>
        <p id="aboutme">I’m currently a first-year BCA student, excited to delve into the world of computer applications and technology. My studies are important to me, as I aim to build a strong foundation for my future career in IT. Beyond academics, I have a passion for gaming, particularly BGMI. I enjoy the thrill of competitive play and the strategy involved in each match, which keeps me engaged and focused.

            In addition to gaming, I play cricket occasionally. It’s a great way for me to stay active and bond with friends, whether we’re playing a casual match or just hanging out at the field. I appreciate the teamwork and camaraderie that come with sports, as they teach valuable life lessons about collaboration and perseverance.
            
            I’m always on the lookout for new challenges, whether in my studies or hobbies. I enjoy meeting new people and sharing experiences, whether in gaming sessions or on the cricket field. Balancing my time between academics and my interests helps me grow both personally and socially.
            
            As I navigate through my first year, I hope to gain new skills and make lasting friendships along the way. I believe that with hard work and passion, I can make the most of my college experience and set the stage for a successful future!</p>
